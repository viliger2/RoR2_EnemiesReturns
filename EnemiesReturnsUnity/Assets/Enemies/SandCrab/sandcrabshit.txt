SandCrab animations:
* Attack1Begin opens claws, then Attack1Charge has claws closed and then Attack1Fire has them open again.
* Blinking is way too frequent, since this is additive animation it will be played at all times. Or specifically, it is way too rythmic, he blinks every X frames for first eye and then Y frames after first eye second eye blinks and then it loops. Make it less rythimic and more "random" and maybe stretch it a lot more, longer time between blinks. You may say its not realistic, since creature do blink pretty frequently, but since eyes are extremely prominent part of the model it will be very noticable how frequently he blinks and, in my opinion, it looks goofy.
* Ascend\Descend not looped at all.
* There is no need for him to constantly snip his claws when walking forward. If you want to keep it, then we can make it similar to blinking, not idle additive blinking that we have, blinking that Imps do, they have a separate layer where only eyes blink and then separate component that controls them does the blinking randomly between 6 eyes, we can do the same here with 2 claws (separate animation for each) and would have to probably disable the layer during attack charge but for the rest of it we can have it hanging. So if you want to keep it isolate snip into separate animation for each claw that does nothing but snip. But now I look at rorr sprite and snipping is looped into walking animation, so I guess it is a reference and it is fine?
