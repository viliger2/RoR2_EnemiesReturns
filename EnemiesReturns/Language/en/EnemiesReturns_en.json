I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWhile exploring a forest, cataloguing its incredibly large trees, Tharson and I were attacked by a swarm of large insects. We had walked blindly into their nest.\r\nThankfully, we managed to escape through a clearing through the tress. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Archer Bug\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Large, wasp-like creatures. Their eyes glow a sickly green, as well as what I assume to be a cavity below their abdomen.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Capable of firing a caustic substance which can melt through metal.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Capable of flight using their wings. Considering their large size, it facinates me that their wings can support their bodies.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When observed, Archer Bugs are highly territorial, anything within 2 miles of a nest are swarmed by the these pests.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Although this is purely speculation, I believe there to be a queen of the hive. However, we lack the evidence to support my theory. (Doccumentation is highly prioritized)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Deathly afraid of fire. By making a campfire, we were able to ward off these pests from our camp.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Unlike most creatures of this facinating planet, these insects like to migrate to other areas of this planet. Reports from Rallypoint Gamma show the Archer Bugs tend to gravitate towards warmer enviroments.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Lastly, we have begun to notice that Archer Bugs tend to antagonise Worker Beetle parties, hurling their toxic bile at them before the beetles quickly retreat underground.\r\n\r\n\u2022 (Note, create report on Beetle rivalry.)",

Their predictive aim is troubling, and they seem to know where I'm headed before I do.\n\nI've witnessed packs of these strange birds circling like vultures in the distant sky, though I've never witnessed any of them scavenging for food.

The giant crab moves surprisingly fast for its size; the foliage growing on its back indicates that they stay still for long periods of time. This crab is either extremely patient or hibernates regularly.\n\nAfter exhausting my supplies in taking it down, I salvaged what meat I could. Very chewy, but not unpleasant.
